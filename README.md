> This product is in alpha stage

A platform for linking issues on GitHub to bounties which are payed out using IOTA.

Features:
* Use a GitHub account to post messages on linked issues with status updates
* Let people pool money on a particular issue to increase the incentive to solve the problem/add the feature.
* Feeless transfer of the bounty to the recipient through IOTA
* Single-page-application to manage linked repositories and bounties
* Written using modern technologies such as TypeScript, React, MobX and Go

## Installation

Prerequisites:
* Ubuntu +18.04
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Public IP address (used for GitHub web hooks)

Recommended:
* An already installed reverse proxy such as nginx

I recommend to setup the application on a VPS, for instance on a Hetzner CX21 instance.

#### Create a bot user
1. Create a new user account on GitHub which is going to be used for the bot handling bounties/messaging from
and to the backend system
2. Generate a personal access token for the bot with permissions for repository and user related actions
3. Keep the token for later installation instructions

#### Setting up the docker image

__1.__ Create a `docker-compose.yml` with following content:
<details>
  <summary>docker-compose.yml</summary>
  
    ```
    version: '3.3'
    
    services:
        ibp:
            image: 'lucamoser/ibp:0.1.0'
            hostname: ibp
            container_name: ibp
            stdin_open: true
            tty: true
            restart: always
            volumes:
                - './app.json:/app/configs/app.json'
                - '/etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro'
                - '/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro'
            command: start
            network_mode: "host"
        ibpmongo:
            image: mongo:4.1
            hostname: ibpmongo
            container_name: ibpmongo
            stdin_open: true
            tty: true
            restart: always
            volumes:
                - './db:/data/db'
                - './mongod.conf:/etc/mongo/mongod.conf'
                - '/etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro'
                - '/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro'
            command: --port 27021 --bind_ip=127.0.0.1
            network_mode: "host"
    ```
  
</details>

The containers are configured to directly run on the "host" system's network card with the above
`docker-compose.yml`.

__2.__ Create a `mongod.conf` with following content:
<details>
  <summary>mongod.conf</summary>
  
  ```
  # mongod.conf
  
  # for documentation of all options, see:
  #   http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/configuration-options/
  
  # where to write logging data.
  systemLog:
    destination: file
    logAppend: true
    path: /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
  
  # Where and how to store data.
  storage:
    dbPath: /var/lib/mongo
    journal:
      enabled: true
  #  engine:
  #  wiredTiger:
  
  # how the process runs
  processManagement:
    pidFilePath: /var/run/mongodb/mongod.pid  # location of pidfile
    timeZoneInfo: /usr/share/zoneinfo
  
  # network interfaces
  net:
    port: 27021
    bindIp: 127.0.0.1  # Enter 0.0.0.0,:: to bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses or, alternatively, use the net.bindIpAll setting.
  
  
  #security:
  
  #operationProfiling:
  
  #replication:
  
  #sharding:
  
  ## Enterprise-Only Options
  ```
</details>

Note that we bind MongoDB to only listen on localhost to ensure it can't be accessed remotely.

__3__. Download the `app.prod.json`
``` 
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luca-moser/iota-bounty-platform/master/server/cmd/configs/app.prod.json
```
rename it to `app.json`
```
$ mv app.prod.json app.json
```

* Change the MongoDB URI in `app.json` to `mongodb://localhost:27021` and adjust `<domain>` 
under `github.web_hook` to your public IP address or domain (note that the port must match between 
`github.web_hook.listen_address` and `github.web_hook.url` unless you're using a NAT configuration or
using a HTTP reverse proxy proxying to the application). Note that the default config lets the application
only listen for webhooks on localhost, this, because it is assumed that a HTTP reverse proxy is used
to handle TLS and logging of web requests before the application container.
* Make sure to also modify `github.web_hook.secret` with a secret (the secret is used by GitHub to sign 
the web hook payloads).
* Add the previously generated auth token under `github.auth_token`.

__4.__ Create a `ibp` file with following content:
<details>
  <summary>ibp</summary>
  
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    
    if [[ $1 == 'start' ]]
    then
            echo 'starting ibp...'
            docker-compose -p ibp up -d
    elif [[ $1 == 'stop' ]]
    then
            echo 'stoppping ibp...'
            docker-compose -p ibp stop
    elif [[ $1 == 'restart' ]]
    then
            echo 'restarting ibp...'
            docker-compose -p ibp restart
    elif [[ $1 == 'reinit' ]]
    then
            echo 'reinitialising ibp...'
            docker-compose -p ibp stop
            docker-compose -p ibp rm -f
            docker-compose -p ibp up -d
    elif [[ $1 == 'destroy' ]]
    then
            echo 'destroying ibp containers...'
            docker-compose -p ibp rm -f
    else
            echo 'commands: <start,stop,restart,reinit,destroy>'
    fi
    ```
</details>

and make it executable
```
$ chmod +x ibp
```

#### Starting the application

Execute `./ibp start` to let docker-compose spin up application and MongoDB container.
The bounty platform should now be available under your domain.

Doing `docker logs ibp` yields the entire log of the application container. You should see something
along the lines of:
```
INFO[09-02|20:31:07] booting up app...                        comp=app
INFO[09-02|20:31:07] connected to GitHub as 'IOTA Bounty Platform Bot' comp=app
INFO[09-02|20:31:07] GitHub Zen message: Non-blocking is better than blocking. comp=app

â‡¨ http server started on [::]:11111

INFO[09-02|20:31:08] listening for web hook events via 127.0.0.1:12111/webhooks comp=bot
```

It is recommended that you setup a HTTP reverse proxy proxying into the application which also takes
care of TLS and logging HTTP requests.

**Troubleshooting:**  
If you see something like:
```
INFO[10-04|20:27:40] booting up app...                        comp=app
panic: GET https://api.github.com/zen: 401 Bad credentials []
```
it means that the defined `github.auth_token` is not valid.

```

## Linking a repository and creating a bounty

Make sure the user authenticated through the defined `github.auth_token` has admin rights to the repository
so the bot can automatically install the web hook. (must be done manually if the bot has no rights)

Add a repository simply by pasting its URL into the form and hitting "ADD REPOSITORY":
<details>
  <summary>Form</summary>
  
  ![add_repo](https://i.imgur.com/KgLRsmB.png)
</details>

Then, simply enter the issue number of the issue you'd like to associate a bounty to:
<details>
  <summary>Form</summary>
  
  ![link_issue](https://i.imgur.com/B4fkIzY.png)
</details>

After the issue has been linked to the application, the bounty bot will post a message saying
that the issue has been associated with a bounty with the given pool address where people can send tokens to,
plus some instruction on how to release the bounty:

![bot_msg](https://i.imgur.com/A4PuX1R.png) 

Note that if you delete the repository or bounty via the web interface, then a corresponding message gets
posted by the bot notifying users on the particular issue that the bounty is no longer available.

> The application keeps some information of the repositories and issues locally stored in the database to
> not fetch data from GitHub all the time, so you might see some slight inconsistencies 
> (wrong issue titles etc.) until the application synchronized itself with GitHub again.
> The synchronization interval can be changed in the configuration.
